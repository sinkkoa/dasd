Agent-based control of a production system

Task description:

The production system (physically located in Ri208, simulator of the system - http://escop.rd.tut.fi:3000)
is composed of 12 work stations. The line makes mobile phones that can come in 729 variations
(3 screen shapes * 3 colours * 3 keyboard shapes * 3 colours * 3 frame shapes * 3 colours).
10 workstations (WS2-WS6; WS8-WS12) are in charge of making mentioned frames, screens and keyboards.
A product can be seen as a combination of a frame, a screen and a keyboard.

The line should be controlled using MAS (Multi-Agent System). You have to identify what is an agent in the context
of given production line, then implement the agents using Node.js and demonstrate the approach by actually
controlling the line.

As a system receives an order to make a mobile phone, the agents should negotiate between each other
developing the way to make the phone and then executing actual production of the phone.
